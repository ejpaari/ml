function [J, grad] = costFunction(theta, X, y)
%COSTFUNCTION Compute cost and gradient for logistic regression
%   J = COSTFUNCTION(theta, X, y) computes the cost of using theta as the
%   parameter for logistic regression and the gradient of the cost
%   w.r.t. to the parameters.

m = length(y);
grad = zeros(size(theta));

% Instructions: Compute the cost of a particular choice of theta.
%               You should set J to the cost.
%               Compute the partial derivatives and set grad to the partial
%               derivatives of the cost w.r.t. each parameter in theta

h = sigmoid(X * theta);
J = 1/m * sum(-y.*log(h) - (1-y) .* log(1-h));
grad = 1/m * (h - y)' * X;
